SenLibrary
==========

Sen Library is a Bukkit/Spigot server library I wrote back in late 2015 and early 2016 to help me make Minecraft plugins easier, the project was originally hosted on BitBucket at [bitbucket.org/Senither/senlibrary](https://bitbucket.org/Senither/senlibrary)

The project can be run like a normal Minecraft plugin, or be included into other projects, the library source code can be found in `src/com/senither/library`.
